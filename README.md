# Neural-Network-Cat-With-Glasses
That is a python project made with trained neural network model. How does it work? Actually pretty simple. Code recognises cat's face and put on glasses on it(thanks to neural network) and generates a new image 'cat_with_glasses'. To make it work properly you need to put all the committed files into one specific folder. That's kinda everything.
